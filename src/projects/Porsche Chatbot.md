A conversational chatbot powered by natural language processing and a neural network trained on custom Porsche related intents. The system uses tokenization, lemmatization, bag of words, and a Keras sequential model to classify user queries into categories such as greetings, model history, fastest cars, and pricing. Based on predicted intent, the bot selects responses from a curated knowledge base about Porsche’s history, models, and record breaking vehicles.

The project demonstrates the fundamentals of intent classification, neural network training, and real time inference in a CLI chatbot environment. While it’s far from the most accurate chatbot, its predictions can sometimes be fuzzy, I love it because it reflects the joy of building something from scratch and seeing a working system come to life. Beyond being a fun demo of Porsche trivia, it also serves as a practical prototype for domain, specific Q&A systems built on lightweight machine learning.
