`bore` is a minimal CLI tool that exposes local ports to a remote server,
bypassing standard NAT connection firewalls. That's all it does: no more, and no
less.

With a single binary, you can expose any number of local TCP ports to the public
internet at a specified remote server address. There is a public instance of the
tunneling server running at `bore.pub`, available for anyone to use, similar to
[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or
[localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel). It's also very easy
to host your own server with a single `bore server` command in the same binary
executable, with optional authentication.
