A blockchain built in Python with a focus on clarity and fundamentals. Each block is linked with SHA-256 hashes and mined using a proof of work system where valid hashes must begin with a fixed number of leading zeros. The system supports adding transactions, block validation, and a full chain integrity check.

I wrote utilities to display the chain in a readable way, verify consistency, and dynamically adjust mining difficulty. The project demonstrates the core principles behind Bitcoin and Ethereum immutability, consensus, and tamper detection, without the overhead of a full cryptocurrency stack.

This was a personal project to discover blockchain mechanics, but it doubles as a lightweight educational demo of distributed ledger concepts.
