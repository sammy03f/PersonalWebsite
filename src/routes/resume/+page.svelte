  <Workplace
    title="Teaching Assistant (Calculus I, II, & III)"
    company="Santa Monica College"

    <li>
     As a Teaching Assistant for three levels of Calculus, 
     I worked directly with three different professors to support over a hundred students each semester 
     in mastering one of the most challenging sequences in mathematics. I wasn’t just grading or answering 
     questions, I was building a bridge between complex material and student understanding.
    </li>
    <li>
      I led weekly problem solving sessions where I broke down difficult concepts like multivariable derivatives, 
      integration techniques, and series convergence into clear components. During office hours and study workshops, 
      I tailored explanations to each student’s learning style, helping them move from confusion to confidence. Many students told me 
      my sessions were the first time the material “clicked.”
    <li>
      I also created fulllength mock exams modeled after the professor’s style, giving students a realistic way to test their 
      knowledge under exam-like conditions. These weren’t just recycled homework problems, they were carefully designed to highlight 
      common pitfalls and integrate multiple concepts into single problems.
      After each mock exam, I held review sessions where we walked through the solutions together, focusing on why certain approaches worked and where students often tripped up. 
      This gave them both the technical practice and the exam day confidence to perform at their best.
    </li>
    <li>
      Here are some of the exams I made: 
      <a class="link" href="/assets/pdf/Practice Exam 5 KONYA MATH 7.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Calculus 1 </a>
      <a class="link" href="/assets/pdf/Practice Exam 2 Soleymani MATH 8 v0.1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Calculus 2 </a>
